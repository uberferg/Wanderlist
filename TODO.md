TODO
-Build up user story in functional_tests/tests.py

  I've become a proponent of TDD since I've been away. I find that it helps me
  drive my development in terms of what features are actually relevant to the 
  project at hand, and, of course, it has the pretty consequence of keeping 
  everything working as expected.

  I'll be happy to take the relatively boring burden of writing tests in the 
  beginning, if you'd like! Feel free to jump on board or work on whatever else
  you find interesting, of course -- just add features I should write tests for
  in here, and I'll make sure to get to it myself.
